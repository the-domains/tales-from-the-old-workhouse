Soon you will be able to follow the renovation of 'The Old Workhouse', at 18th century building at the verge of collapse.

However there are people that love this building and want to work hard to turn it into a modern living space which honorers it's past.

We hope you will follow us as we work to keep this building standing for many years to come. We hope you will want to learn more about this building, it's history and the work that has to be done to ensure it's survival.

Thank you for your interest and I look forward to showing you more in the near future.

Adam Roxby, The Governer.
