Welcome to 'The Old Workhouse'

After months of work and planning; lugging bricks, removing tiles, clearing boxes, fighting with the vegetation I am now ready to start sharing this experience with you.

This is the trailer where I give a brief introduction to what we were are doing.

Finally I wanted to say a bit about [Patreon][0] and why were on it (a dedicated explanation video is on it's way).

Simply put; [Patreon][0] is way for people to give a small amount of money each month to help fund the creation of these videos and to speed up the restoration of The Old Workhouse.

However if you can't that's fine because our regular episodes will always be free.

So be sure to subscribe, check out the other ways in which you can stay in touch and I will see you for episode one coming next week.
